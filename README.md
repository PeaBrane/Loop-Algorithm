# Loop-Algorithm
An algorithm for generating hard weighted Max-2-SAT instances with frustrated loops on a bipartite Ising spin glass.
A complete description of the algorithm is provided here, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05334, which includes analytic and empirical studies on the hardness properties of the generated instances.
